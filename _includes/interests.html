			    My personal interests include:
        </p>
			<ul>
			  <li>
				 <b>Deep learning</b>. It is an exciting time for machine learning. I'm currently working through several online classes, and enjoy sharing articles with collegues.
			  </li>
			  <li>
				  <b>Quadcopters</b>. I've been an enthusiastic hobbiest since I was a teenager - but only as an adult am I able to afford the higher-quality
          components. I like to grow into larger batteries as well as the larger, faster motors. 
			  </li>
			  <li>
				  <b>Running</b>. When it's not over 100 degrees here in Austin, I try to maintain a 12 miles a week. I enjoy spending weekend on 
				  long runs and long post-run naps.
      </li>
			</ul>
